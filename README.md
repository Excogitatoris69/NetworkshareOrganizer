# Networkshare Organizer

Why do you need the program?   
To access a network share on a computer, you have to connect a network drive to it under Windows operating systems. This is usually done in two ways.
-	A network drive is set up in the file manager.
-	In the command prompt, the command "net use" is used.
The NetworkShare Organizer program facilitates these work steps.

## Motivation
Why did I develop this program?
I work a lot with network drives because I have to manage many computers with different network shares. All network shares have different paths, different users and passwords and they should be able to be connected with changing drive letters.
Using the Windows network drive dialogs or the command prompt with the *"net use"* command seemed too cumbersome to me. With the multitude of my networks, paths and users, I would have always had to maintain a list that would also have contained the passwords in plain text.
I needed a program that would make it easier for me to manage all these parameters and set up and clear connections quickly and easily. This is how this NetworkShare Organizer program came about.

## Where can I find the program?
I published the program on Github. Parts of the program code can also be viewed there: https://github.com/Excogitatoris69/NetworkshareOrganizer
